# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game API

## Description
This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game API built using FastAPI SQLAlchemy and SQLite. It allows players (humans or machines) to play multi-round games, record results, and access global game statistics. 
The API includes features to calculate the strongest and weakest hands for human players, a player ranking, and unit tests using pytest, between others.
