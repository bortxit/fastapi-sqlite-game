# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game API

## Description
This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game API built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Docker. It allows players (humans or machines) to play multi-round games, record results, and access global game statistics. 
The API includes features to calculate the strongest and weakest hands for human players, players' ranking, and unit tests using pytest, doctest, between others.

## Features
- Create and record new games with multiple rounds.
- Record moves and determine the winner of each round.
- Calculate global game statistics, wins, losses, and win percentages.
- Determine the strongest and weakest hands for a player.
- Get a ranking of players based on the number of victories.
- Automated testing using pytest.
- Docker support for easy deployment.
